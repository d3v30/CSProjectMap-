# CSProjectMap-

Week 1 - 
  Prior to begining our project, we evaulated different types of projects and was able to reach a mutaul agreement amonst each other and chose to add our own twist to the Zelda Walking Tour Code. 
  
Week 2 - 
  Analyze the code, and tried to understand pyganim is and how it applies to our code specifically. 
  In addition, we also signed up for Github and began to familiarize ourselves with it
   
Week 3 - 
  During week 3 we are able to finally get Github partially working and began researching how collisions work in python
  Figuring out collisions for our group was extremetly tough and time consuming
  
Week 4 - 
  We added background music to enhance user experience 
  After researching thoroughly, we were finally able to successfully do rectangle based collisions
  
 Week 5 - 
   This week we spent all our time working on manipulating our current code in order to ensure that our code runs smoothly 
   We also analyzed other projects and games to see how we could make our game better
   
Week 6 - 
   We interchanged out the images and put in images of a Centar

Week 7 - 
   We did research on how to add ps3 controlls to the game, unfortunately was not able to succeed in writing the code to enable a ps3 controller to work in our game. However, we were able to add joystick controls.

Biggest Challenge:
   Our biggest challenege we had to overcome within our project was figuring out the collisions
